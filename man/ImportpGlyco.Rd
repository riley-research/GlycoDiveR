\arguments{
\item{path}{The folder path, which will be used to find all
'pGlycoDB-GP-FDR-Pro-Quant-Site.txt' files in this folder and all subfolders.}

GetAnnotationTemplate("path", tool = "pGlyco")}

\item{fastaPath}{The path to the fasta file that was used.}

\item{peptideScoreCutoff}{The score cutoff for the "PeptideFDR" column. The cutoff
is the upper limit.}

\item{glycanScoreCutoff}{The score cutoff for the "GlycanFDR" column. The score is the
upper limit.}

\item{normalization}{The (glyco)peptide normalization used.
Choose between "none" or "median" (default = "median").}

\item{scrape}{set TRUE/FALSE to use scraping of Uniprot data.}

\value{
Formatted GlycoDiveR data file.

\description{
This is the importer for pGlyco data. It needs to untouched pGlyco output, which
is a .txt file named 'pGlycoDB-GP-FDR-Pro-Quant-Site.txt'. This script will look
for all files in the folder and all subfolders.
